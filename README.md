# the-note-taker

The Note Taker challenge was good to me! I learned about the three essential functionalities of get, post and delete as well as work with some starter code and deploy an application on heroku! In the beginning of the project. I was a little lost, navigating between files and understanding how the routes connected with one another and what role each one played. In the end it was a very educational experience and I had fun working with tutors to sort everything out in terms of my understanding !
